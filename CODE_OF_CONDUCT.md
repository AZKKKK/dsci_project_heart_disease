GOALS

1. What are our team goals for this project? 
Gain understanding in using GitHub with team members (writing commits, pushing and pulling code, addressing/making issues).
Practice  wrangling data into specific/required formats that effectively answer questions about the data.
Apply, and interpret a dataset using classification or regression.

2. What do we want to accomplish? 
Gain competency in python and using GitHub.
Create, and interpret, meaningful tables from wrangled data.
Collaborate with others using version control.

3. What skills do we want to develop or refine? 
Through this project we hope to develop and refine our skills in: 
Team work : time management/project timelines, problem-solving, communicating ideas.
Data science: python language learning, wrangling data, data visualization, communication through version control. 

EXPECTATIONS:

1. What do we expect of one another regarding attendance at meetings, participation, frequency of communication, quality of work, etc.? 
Communication will be held through an Instagram group chat. We expect responses to messages to be made within a reasonable timeframe (1-2 business days).
Meetings will be held weekly in-person on Fridays to discuss progress and review work (1-2pm). 
Keep clear and detailed records of updates to the code (commits).
Make sure to push operational edits to the repository, else if there are challenges make sure to communicate with members early and collaborate on solutions. 

POLICIES & PROCEDURES:

1. What rules can we agree on to help us meet our goals and expectations? 
Attend all meetings, and engage in active listening and constructive feedback with group members. Uphold respectful behaviour between group members. 
Give other team members prior notice if unable to attend a Friday meeting. 
Set realistic project timelines, and prioritize tasks/manage time and divide work equally. 

CONSEQUENCES:

1. How will we address non-performance regarding these goals, expectations, policies and procedures? 
Absences to team meetings without any notice will be recorded and added to the team work report.  
Frequent absences and/or inability to complete work without reason or communication may require members to seek advice/support with the teaching team.
